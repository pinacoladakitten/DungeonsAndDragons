# DungeonsAndDragons
School Project 2
This is a simple Dungeons and Dragons game I made for a programming class, rules should be easy to follow as you play.
Not sure if I have to explain how everything works since D&D is quite a complex game, but I tried making everything
fairly easy to understand to anyone new.
