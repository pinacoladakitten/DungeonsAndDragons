~Welcome to the world of Dungeons & Dragons! Usually playing the
normal game is quite complex, however I decided to simplify some
things to make the combat easier to understand.

[CAMPAIGN START]
Great! Now let's start the campaign!

You are a bounty hunter hired by the Lord of this land to 
investigate the whereabouts of the evil Warlock, Mark Lehr,
since there have been rumors of his return after a 100 year
long rest.
(STOP)

[BATTLE1]
After traversing a forest, you come across a castle, which
many today dubbed 'NASA Keep', home to the Warlock Lehr. You
see a guard at the door staring at you with deadly intent.
(STOP)

[BATTLE1.5]
"Halt! Lehr will not be seeing anyone! Leave this instant!", 
the guard then immediately sprints toward you. The battle begins!
(STOP)

[CAMPAIGN PT2]
You defeated the guard! Onward!! You vigorously proceed into the
castle now fully aware that Lehr is back and you are the land's only
hope of stopping him from bringing darkness into the world. You also
want that cash from the reward.

[BATTLE2]
As you make your way into the main hall, you can hear Lehr say,

"MUWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! I WASN'T EXPECTING ANY RODENTS FROM THE
KINGDOM TO COME THIS EARLY! YOU WILL NEVER STOP ME FROM LAUNCHING
MY BALLISTIC MISSILE INTO THE KINGDOM! TRY AND STOP ME HAHAHAHAHA!"
(STOP)

[BATTLE2.5]
Two more of Lehr's Bunny Guards show up! The second battle commences!!
(STOP)

[BATTLE3]
You defeated the two Bunny Guards!! Soon afterward you sprint up
to the top of NASA Keep to find Lehr sitting on his throne looking
straight at you!
(STOP)

[BATTLE3.5]
"AH HAH! THERE YOU ARE, OK LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH, I'VE ALREADY GOT
THE NOOSE READY COME ON!", he pulls out a large noose for you to see
in terror as you notice how much time as passed.
(STOP)

[BATTLE3.75]
"THIS NOOSE'S POWER IS UNSTOPPABLE SINCE IT'S POWER INCREASES AS TIME
PROGRESSES FURTHER! 100 YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE MY LAST AWAKENED STATE
AND DURING MY SLUMBER THE NOOSE ONLY GREW MUCH GREATER!!"
(STOP)

[BATTLE3.95]
"NOW COME! FIGHT ME! SO I CAN LAUNCH MY BALLISTIC MISSILE ALREADY!"
~~~The battle begins!!
(STOP)
